WARNING: I have only run the INI file script so far.

1. Note to self:

GLORYS has a default spval of -32.xxx for temp and salt. This is not
a good idea for ROMS, with its:

       IF (ABS(wrk(i)).ge.ABS(Aspval)) THEN
	   wrk(i)=0.0_r8                 ! masked with _FillValue

You need:

ncatted -a _FillValue,temp,m,d,1.e37 -a _FillValue,salt,m,d,1.e37
GLORYS2V3_1dAV_19980101_1998010_ic_ARCTIC2.nc

Do this after the remapping (at least for salt).


2. I chose to combine the fields for one day into one for the initial
conditions. It's kind of a pain, so you probably want to handle the
boundary conditions field by field, then combine them afterwards.

Some of the history:

3. This is an arctic domain, using yrange to subset the world.
A more equatorial problem should use irange, jrange instead. Be
consistent and edit all the *.py files here consistently.
