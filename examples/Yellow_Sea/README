The boundary and initial conditions are derived from SODA
(http://www.atmos.umd.edu/~ocean/). For another domain, you will
have to change all the python files under the Inputs directory. New
domains will require changes to irange, jrange, and the names of the
files it searches for - just search on YELLOW to find them all.

irange and jrange are the range of indices on the SODA grid to be
searched. You can save a lot of time by picking judicious values -
or you can mess up and miss your target.
